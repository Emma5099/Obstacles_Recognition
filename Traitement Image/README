How-to
De-zip the Image_Test
Execute the Image_test.py
The program should exectute on the green heart.

This project was suppose to be a part of a bigger project: the command of a robot (with Stm32, Raspberry, communication master-slave)for it to move in space, switch on the light, capture sound, diffuse sound...)
A part of the project was to take pictures of obstacles, to tell what type of obstacles they were and to avoid them.
We had the idea of detecting the shapes and colors with image recognition. 
We then introduce a dataset of pictures of the differents obstacles to 'train' the algorithm. 

The result works ok but could be way better if the dataset was larger. The dataset was stocked locally in this computer so  it was impossible to input a larg set of datas.
Especially for pictures from the side, it is difficult for the program to detect what shape it is. 

This program has been inspired from a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FHtTyZxS5s
